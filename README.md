# Scramjet Transform Hub <!-- omit in toc -->

Scramjet Transform Hub is an execution system that is installed on a managed
server by the developer. Once installed, it will serve as an execution platform for
programs on this server. You will be able to quickly and simply execute
programs on this platform, which will automatically forge connections between
programs and allow for remote control of program running, managing and
termination.

This is the STH development repo.

## Intro

The readme file contains information about the development process of the STH. It is focused mainly on a day by day commands. Commands won't work as long as you don't set up the environment correctly. You can [find setup instructions in the docs.](docs/development-guide/README.md)

## How to start development

Follow the below information to start development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:scramjetorg/transform-hub.git      # clone the repo
cd transform-hub/                                           # enter the cloned directory
yarn install                                                # install dependencies
yarn build:all                                              # build all packages
                                                            #    -> modules, samples and docker images
yarn global add file:$(pwd)/dist/cli                        # install the cli
yarn packseq
yarn start                                                  # start the hub
```

Now in another window:

```bash
# this will upload the program to the host
SEQ_ID=$(./scripts/_/upload-sequence packages/samples/example/)

# this will start the sequence
INSTANCE_ID=$(curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-raw '{"appConfig": {},"args": ["/package/data.json"]}' http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sequence/$SEQ_ID/start | jq ".id" -r);

# this will show the stdout
stdbuf -o0 -e0 curl --no-progress-meter -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/instance/$INSTANCE_ID/stdout"
```

## Basic commands

```bash
yarn install:clean      # Removes dist directories, cleans node_modules, installs packages
yarn build              # Build all packages and reference apps
yarn build:all-packages # Builds packages only
yarn build:refapps      # Builds reference apps only
yarn bic                # Build only the changed components
yarn lint               # Check and fix syntax
yarn watch              # Watch files
yarn lint:dedupe        # Check if there are packages to deduplicate
yarn pack:pre           # Move linked packages to dist/ (alias: yarn prepack)
yarn pack:pub           # Prepare (unlink) packages for publication and move to dist/
```

## Start host

```bash
yarn start                          # Starts Host after it's been built
node dist/host/bin/start            # This is the same as above
ts-node packages/host/src/bin/start # This starts node from source code
```

## Lerna commands

Add new package:

```bash
lerna create package_name
```

List all of the public packages in the current Lerna repo:

```bash
lerna ls
```

Run an npm script in each package that contains that script.

```bash
lerna run [script]
```

Run script in all packages excluding one package:

```bash
lerna run --ignore @scramjet/<package_name> <script-name>
```

... or run script excluding more packages

```bash
lerna run --ignore @scramjet/<package_name> --ignore @scramjet/<package_name> <script-name>
```

Run script only in one package

```bash
lerna run --scope @scramjet/<package_name> <script-name>
```

Run script in more packages

```bash
lerna run --scope @scramjet/<package_name> --scope @scramjet/<package_name> <script-name>
```

## Clean build

```bash
yarn install:clean   # this command will perform yarn clean && yarn clean:modules && yarn install at once
yarn build:all-packages    # optionally build:all if you want all dockerfiles.
yarn prepack              # moves files to ./dist/
```

## Docker commands

```bash
docker ps                      # list containers
docker volume prune -f         # remove all unused local volumes
docker system prune --all -f   # remove all unused images not just dangling ones
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) # stops all running containers
```

> *(`-f`) -  don't prompt confirmation

## Install Host and execute

After built and prepack is done, install and run Host:

```bash
npm install -g ./dist/hub  # installs packages globally
scramjet-transform-hub     # starts host
```

You can also install current Hub release from registry:

```bash
npm install -g @scramjet/hub
scramjet-transform-hub
```

## Install CLI and execute

In the root folder, after building and prepacking, run the following commands:

```bash
npm i -g ./dist/cli # install CLI globally
si help             # show CLI commands
```

You can also install the package from NPM.

```bash
npm i -g @scramjet/cli # install CLI globally
si help                # show CLI commands
```

> **HINT:** If something goes wrong make clean, install, and prepack.

### Build Host on Docker

Build from current source:

```bash
cd ./packages/host/
yarn build:docker
```

Build current release:

```bash
cd ./packages/host/
yarn build:docker-release
```

### Run Transform Hub in Docker

```bash
cd ./packages/sth/
docker-compose up

# or run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

To run Hub without docker-compose:

```bash
docker run -d --init \
  --name scramjet-hub \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /tmp/:/tmp/ \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  scramjetorg/host:$(jq -r .version < package.json)
```

## Run components

### Runner

Starting `Runner` script: `./packages/runner/src/bin/start-runner.ts`

Example of usage:

```bash
node dist/runner/bin/start-runner.js sequence-file-path fifo-files-path
```

### HostOne

Starting `HostOne` script: `./packages/host-one/src/bin/start-host-one.ts`

Example of usage:

```bash
node dist/host-one/bin/start-host-one.js sequence-file-path config-file-path
```

## Sequences and samples

To run sequence / sample (example Alice), first, you need to install all the dependencies, [install and execute host](#install-host-and-execute), compress the package, and then you're good to go and use curl commands.

> **HINT:** The following instructions apply to the state of the repository from the `release/0.10`.

### Compress the package

The sequence in a `tar.gz` file format with package.js (aka package) can be generated in different ways.

Assuming that you have the [host running](#install-host-and-execute) use command:

```bash
yarn packseq # this creates tar.gz for all packages in the repo
```

When the host is not running you can use a script:

```bash
lerna run prepare-sample-tar
```

To compress specific package use linux tar command:

```bash
tar -C /path/to/package/dir czf <package-name.tar.gz> .
```

### "Hello Alice" sample

To execute the sample run the commands listed below from the level of the main folder.

If the sequence is not packed:

```bash
lerna run prepare-sample-tar
```

> HINT: remember that to use curl commands host must be running.  [See how to execute host =>](#install-host-and-execute)

Now upload the package:

```bash
SEQ_ID=$(
    curl -H 'content-type: application/octet-stream' \
    --data-binary '@packages/samples/hello-alice-out.tar.gz' \
    "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sequence" | jq ".id" -r
)
```

You can use the following that will build and send any of the reference packages and samples in this repo:

```bash
SEQ_ID=$(./scripts/_/upload-sequence packages/samples/hello-alice-out) # -> when you want to upload the package (it will be built if needed)
SEQ_ID=$(./scripts/_/upload-sequence packages/samples/hello-alice-out -r) # -> when you want to upload the package and make sure it's rebuilt
SEQ_ID=$(./scripts/_/upload-sequence dist/my-package.tgz -r) # -> when you want to upload a ready tarball
```

> **HINT:** INSTANCE_ID and SEQ_ID are shell variables.

Start the sequence and see the output from it.

```bash
INSTANCE_ID=$(curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-raw '{"appConfig": {},"args": ["/package/data.json"]}' http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sequence/$SEQ_ID/start | jq ".id" -r)
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/instance/$INSTANCE_ID/stdout"
```

as a result you should see something like this in the console:

```bash
Hello Alice!
Hello Ada!
Hello Aga!
Hello MichaÅ‚!
Hello Maciek!
Hello Marcin!
Hello Patryk!
Hello RafaÅ‚!
Hello Aida!
Hello Basia!
Hello Natalia!
Hello Monika!
Hello Wojtek!
Hello Arek!
```

after that hit enter and type kill to exit the process:

```bash
sequence: kill
```

[See more about streams and curl commands =>](docs/development-guide/stream-and-api.md)

> **HINT:** If something goes wrong run clean, build and prepack.

Copy and paste ðŸ¤ž

  ```bash
  lerna run clean && lerna run build && lerna run prepack
  ```

## How to run tests

Make unit and bdd tests via command:

```bash
yarn test
```

It will execute:

```bash
yarn test:parallel && yarn test:bdd
```

### Unit tests

```bash
yarn test:packages
```

If you want to run a particular test file, go to directory where the test file is and run command:

```bash
npx ava name-of-the-file.spec.ts
```

If you want to run one particular test in the file, go to directory where the test file is and run command:

```bash
npx ava name-of-the-file.spec.ts -m "Name-of-the-unit-test"
```

If you add `-w` a the end of the command above the test will run automaticaly after every change you make in the test, eg.:

```bash
npx ava runner.spec.ts -m "Stop sequence" -w
```

### BDD tests

The following instructions apply to the state of the repository from the `release/0.10`.
BDD tests are located in a `bdd` folder, to execute them simply follow the steps below:

- start with:

```bash
yarn clean && yarn install && yarn build:all && yarn prepack && yarn packseq
```

Remeber if you want to test core dump file you must set ```echo '/cores/core.%e.%p' | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern``` on your linux machine.

- execute all bdd test from the command line:

```bash
yarn test:bdd
```

- or execute a particular bdd scenario by adding the scenario title after a `--name` flag:

```bash
yarn test:bdd --name="Execute example HelloAlice"
```

Results of the performed test will be displayed in the console. There is also a report generated in `html` which illustrates the results in a very user friendly form. Html report is generated every time we run a bdd test, those html's are saved in `bdd/reports` folder.

In a result of runnung all the test, both unit and bdd (command: `yarn test`), Lerna goes through all the packages and runs unit tests and also checks the `bdd` directory and runs all bdd scenarios.

If you see the error along the way, that means some tests were not passed.

Below you can see an example, which shows the result of all passed unit test in all the packages:

```bash
lerna success run Ran npm script 'test' in 17 packages in 26.1s:
lerna success - @scramjet/adapters
lerna success - @scramjet/api-client
lerna success - @scramjet/api-server
lerna success - @scramjet/sth-config
lerna success - @scramjet/host

lerna success - @scramjet/symbols
lerna success - @scramjet/test-ava-ts-node
lerna success - @scramjet/types
Done in 26.66s.
```

## Publish

To perform full publishing of packages with build and install, perform
the following commands:

```bash
# <clone>
yarn cache clean           # optional clean cache
yarn install               # install dependencies
yarn build:all-packages    # build all packages
yarn bump:version          # bump version and docker images prior to publishing
yarn bump:postversion      # prepare dist folder, publish packages from dist, push git tags
```
